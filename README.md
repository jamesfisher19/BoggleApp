## Project Overview
Based on the famous Boggle game, Boggle Solver is a simple game I developed during my software engineering course at Howard University, using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, and Firebase. This interactive web application allows you to login with your email and customize game modes with features such as word length, starting letter, and grid size.
